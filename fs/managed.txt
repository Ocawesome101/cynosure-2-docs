                           ** Managed File Systems **

    Cynosure 2's managed file system driver provides a shallow layer of abstraction over OpenComputers' filesystem component.  This layer provides support for file permissions and modes.

    These file attributes are stored as the file name, prefixed with a . and postfixed with a .attr - such that the attributes for the following file:

        /bin/ls

    are stored at:

        /bin/.ls.attr

    and the attributes for the following file:

        /root/.shrc

    are stored at:

        /root/..shrc.attr


    The filesystem driver disallows direct modification of these files.  They may only be changed with the setattr(),, chmod(), and chown() system calls.  They may only be accessed with the stat() system call.
