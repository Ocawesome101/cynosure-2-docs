                             ** Filesystem Nodes **

    This document outlines the requirements for filesystem nodes.

    Each filesystem node must provide the following methods:

      node:exists(path): boolean
      node:stat(path): table
      node:chmod(path, mode)
      node:chown(path, uid, gid)
      node:link(source, dest)
      node:unlink(path)
      node:mkdir(path)
      node:opendir(path): dirfd
      node:readdir(dirfd): { inode=number, name=string }
      node:open(path, mode): fd
      node:read(fd, fmt): string
      node:write(fd, data)
      node:flush(fd)
      node:close(fd|dirfd)
